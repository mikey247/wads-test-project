# Introduction

Wagtail is an open source CMS that sits on top of Django, the hugely popular Python based web framework. This repository contains the Web Applications Development Service's custom wagtail installation with modifications made to fit within the University of Manchester's technical infrastructure.

This guide walks through the steps required to set up your own wagtail project locally on your development machine, using this repository as a template.

For documentation on deploying the site onto a Research Virtual Machine, consult the wider documentation that can be found [here](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail-documentation/blob/main/development-documentation/tutorial/set_up_deploy_env/set_up_deploy.md).
## Requirements

### Windows

    Windows Subsystem Linux (recommended)

    OR

    Python 3.7+
    virtualenv
    Git Bash
    Command Line Interface
    Python IDE / Text editor

    NOTE: All commands that use "git" are done in Git Bash. It lets you use MinGW/Linux tools with Git at the command line. Other commands can be done in Git Bash as well but you may prefer to use a different CLI.


### Linux / WSL

    Python 3.7+
    virtualenv
    Git
    Command Line Interface
    Python IDE / Text editor


NOTE - Set-up instructions for Windows Subsystem Linux can be found here - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
If you are using a managed laptop you will need access to the BIOS settings to allow virtualization. We recommend using the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as your distro to match the VM's that will be hosting the deployed site.


## Wagtail Setup

We will be collecting files the necessary files to run our Wagtail. All projects are based on the core `wads-wagtail` repository. This is a version of wagtail that has been developed to suit the needs of the 
research community. Many features from previous wagtail projects have been back ported. 

Another repository called [`wads-wagtail-apps`](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail-apps) contains web applications that have been made generic so they can be re-used on other projects.

### 1. Cloning the Repo

We want to create a new version of `wads-wagtail` to serve as the basis of your project.

There are several way to do this. 

#### a. Manual Method

Create a new repository on GitHub. Name it `wads-<new_project_name>`

On your computer -

`git clone https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail.git`

`cd wads-wagtail`

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail-<new_project_name>.git`

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail.git`

`git push origin main`

Clone your new repository to your computer and work from that.

#### b. Template Method

In the `wads-wagtail` repo on Github choose the 'Use this Template' option.

Name the new repo - `wads-wagtail-<new_project_name>`

Clone your new repository to your computer and work from that.

NOTE - using the template option will mean losing the version history of the `wads-wagtail` repo.

#### c. Import Method

In the top right of Github, click the '+' next to your username and choose 'Import Directory'.

Choose the `wads-wagtail` repo as the one you want to import.

Name the new repo - `wads-wagtail-<new_project_name>`

Clone your new repository to your computer and work from that.

NOTE - there can be issues using this method due to GitHub Authentication. Choose the manual method if this is the case and you want to preserve version history.

### 2. Setting up your Development Environment

#### a. edit .git/info/exclude

As all RSE's have different development environments it is a good idea to add certain files and directories to the the `.git/info/exclude` file.

This includes things like -

- IDE setup directories e.g. `.idea` or `.vscode`
- __pycache__ files
- python virtual environment directories (if the environment is in the same directory as the git repo)

Adding these to the `exlcude` file allows for a streamlined repo that is easily reproducible and cuts down on a bloated `.gitignore` file.

An example would look like - 

    *-venv
    *-env
    .vscode
    __pycache__
#### b. Set up required branches

Depending on how you created your project repo you may have a few stray branches. You will need a minimum of 3.

`main` - the main branch\
`deploy` - the deploy branch that will be used on the sites VM\
`wads-wagtail-main` - the main branch of the `wads-wagtail` repo. Used to bring any new changes or fixes that have been made in `wads-wagtail` to your project.

If you haven't got a `deploy` branch, create it with -

`git checkout main`

`git checkout -b deploy`

`git push origin deploy`

To create the upstream `wads-wagtail-main` branch - 

1. Check if you have the wads-wagtail repo set up as an upstream for your repo 

    (this depends on how you cloned your repo in the steps above):

    `git remote -v`
    
    If the following is in the list:
    
    `upstream	https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail.git (fetch)`
    
    `upstream	https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail.git (push)`
    
    ... you are OK. If not you need to add the upstream with the following command:

    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/wads-wagtail.git`

2. Fetch the upstream code:

    `git checkout -b wads-wagtail-main`

    `git fetch upstream main`

    `git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main`

    Confirm upstream has been set-up:

    `git remote -v`

    Revert to main:

    `git checkout main`


Now we have all the files and branches, we need to install the necessary packages; create a database, superuser, and start a development server to make sure everything is working.

#### c. Install packages

We will be creating a virtual environment to contain all the required packages. All commands that utilise python will require the virtual environment to be activated. You will need to use Python 3.7+ (as of 10/01/2023).

##### Windows

`virtualenv <virtualenv_name>`

`<virtualenv_name>\Scripts\activate`

`pip install -r requirements.00.core.txt`

`pip install -r requirements.01.dev.txt`

NOTE - the other two requirements aren't necessary for development and may cause issues on Windows as they require specific Linux-based packages to be installed.

##### Linux / WSL

`virtualenv <virtualenv_name>`

`source <virtualenv_name>/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.00.core.txt`

`pip install -r requirements.01.dev.txt`

NOTE - the other two requirements aren't necessary for development but can be installed in a Linux environment.


#### d. Configure local.py

We now need to configure your `local.py`. You may have noticed that it doesn't exist and is included in the `.gitignore`.

To create it, make a copy of the `template_dev_local.py` and name it `local.py`. 

Fill in the details as needed such as the site name, base url, database details etc.

For the Secret Key a good tool to use is - https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/

NOTE - if you are on Windows you can comment out the DATABASES setting.


#### e. Create a database

##### Windows

This will create a sqlite database that can be used for development purposes.

`cd path/to/directory/containing manage.py/file`

`python manage.py migrate`

##### Linux / WSL

Ubuntu includes PostgreSQL by default. To install PostgreSQL on Ubuntu, use the apt-get (or other apt-driving) command -

`apt-get install postgresql-12`

Then to set-up the database. 

###### Manual 

Take a note of the database name and password as you will need the details later - 

- `sudo -i`
- `su - postgres`
- `psql`
- `CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;`
- `CREATE USER <database_user_name> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';`
- `ALTER ROLE <database_user_name> SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';`
- `ALTER ROLE <database_user_name> SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';`
- `ALTER ROLE <database_user_name> SET timezone TO 'UTC';`
- `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <database_user_name>;`
- `\q`
- exit
- exit

After `exit`ing twice you should now be back to your normal user account.

###### Automatic

Edit - `/fixtures/scripts/database.00.init.sql`

Then run the script with - `sudo -EHu postgres bash -c "psql < ./fixtures/scripts/database.00.init.sql"`

##### edit local.py

Once the database has been created you will need to edit the `local.py` file with the database information.

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'NAME': '<INSERT DATABASE NAME HERE>',
            'USER': '<INSERT USER NAME HERE>',
            'PASSWORD': '<INSERT PASSWORD NAME HERE>',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '',
        }
    }


##### create migration files and migrate them to the database

`cd <path/to/directory/containing manage.py/file>`

`python manage.py makemigrations article`
`python manage.py makemigrations event`
`python manage.py makemigrations home`
`python manage.py makemigrations siteuser`

`python manage.py migrate`

NOTE - the same process will be used on the VM.

#### f. Create a superuser

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

Enter details when prompted. Then - 

`python manage.py migrate`

NOTE - you can do the `createsuperuser` command above before the `migrate` command if you want to cut down on number of migration files.

#### g. run the development server

`python manage.py runserver`

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and you should be greeted with the default homepage. 

You can then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to access the Wagtail CMS using the superuser username and password created earlier.

NOTE - you can run the server on `localhost` as well using - `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080`. If it throws up an error you may need to add `0.0.0.0` to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in your `local.py` file.

#### OPTIONAL - Set-up homepage

You can set-up the homepage manually  -

1. Login to the /admin page using the superuser account created earlier. By default Wagtail installs a basic home page and needs to be replaced.
2. On the left-hand admin menu, select Pages and then Pages in the pop-out menu.
3. The Root page should now display a list of pages including the default Welcome to your new Wagtail site
4. Select ADD CHILD PAGE
5. Select Home page as the type of page (model) to use.
6. Provide a title, and at least one Body block (Markdown paragraph is recommended)
7. Select Publish in the menu at the bottom of the page.
8. Back on the main left-hand admin menu, select Settings and Sites
9. On the SITES page, select the locahost site to edit it.
10. Uncheck the Is default site.
11. Select SAVE.
12. Back on the SITES page, select ADD A SITE
13. Enter the your.fqdn (or localhost), the port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS), the site name, then select the newly created home page. Check Is default site if required (recommended).
14. Select SAVE

## Next Steps
### Developing for Wagtail

Now you have a development copy of wagtail ready to start building your project.

Developing for Wagtail follows a general development pipeline - 

1. develop your app or feature on a separate branch to `main` - (you create an app with - `./manage.py startapp appname` (Linux/WSL) or `python manage.py startapp appname`(Windows))
2. if there are changes to the database run the `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands
3. test your work in the browser
4. repeat the first 3 steps until complete

When the development work is done push it to GitHub WITHOUT the migration files. The reason for this is we want to keep the migration files on the server 
as clean as possible and not contain all the tests we have done in development.

 then -

1. create a pull request to merge into `main`
2. merge `main` into `deploy`

On a clean version of the repo separate from where you have done your development work do the `./manage.py makemigrations`

1. on the VM where the site is hosted pull your changes down with `git pull`
2. do a `./manage.py migrate` to migrate the changes to the live database
3. if you have made any changes in the `static` folder you will need to also run the `./manage.py collectstatic` command.
