    Summary:
    Defines a user_callback method which is triggered by django_auth_ldap "populate_user"
    events to check and map LDAP groupMembership to Django/Wagtail groups using auxillary
    settings.
   
    Background:
    The UoM/ITS implementation of LDAP groups is not compatible with the group types
    that django_auth_ldap supports by default. The siteconfig/auth.py file implements
    a new LDAPGroupType that accomplishes the needs to determine groupMembership for
    basic authentication. However, there is no immediate way to map those memberships
    to named Django/Wagtail groups.

    Solution:
    Setup django_auth_ldap settings as required for user authentication and basic
    groupMembership checks. This callback then uses additional settings to help map
    LDAP groupMembership to Django groups.

    Settings:
    XAUTH_LDAP_GROUPS_FROM_MEMBERSHIP provides a mechanism to ASSIGN group membership
    based on the user being AUTHENTICATED AS A MEMBER of one or more LDAP groups.

    It should be defined as a dictionary, with Django group names as keys, each with values
    as arrays of LDAP DNs (as used in AUTH_* settings.

    (Example)
    XAUTH_LDAP_GROUPS_FROM_MEMBERSHIP = {
        'Moderators': [
            'cn=admin-mc-ResearchIT-webadmin,ou=mc,ou=admin,ou=uman,o=ac,c=uk',
        ],
    }

    XAUTH_LDAP_GROUPS_FROM_NON_MEMBERSHIP provides a mechanism to ASSIGN group membership
    based on the user being FAILING AUTHENTICATION AS A MEMBER of one or more LDAP groups.

    (Example)
    XAUTH_LDAP_GROUPS_FROM_NON_MEMBERSHIP = {
        'Editors': [
            'cn=admin-mc-ResearchIT-webadmin,ou=mc,ou=admin,ou=uman,o=ac,c=uk',
        ]
    }
