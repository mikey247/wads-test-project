# Wagtail Admin
1) Wagtail admin needs an update where events and articles can be managed better. 
It's hard to manage a great deal of items when there are so many.
wagtail modeladmin has support for redoing index view pages, though it would be under a different main menu item.

# Front End Pagination
2) Front end pagination as a single page app/dynamic update/Ajax thing. Would allow lists of articles/events to be sorted, filtered on fields.

# Fixed Menus
3) Better handling of fixed menus. It's not at obvious to make a flat menu called uom_footer.

# Sidebar Content Chooser
4) Some way of letting users pick sidebar content for pages. Either directly or with Snippets. 
It would be nice if sidebar selection was inherited from a parent e.g., specify what appears in ArticleIndexPage, 
then all child articles inherit the same set. (This requires changes to modeladmin (think) it's the only way to get default streamfield content. 
It's easy to say for example that "correct_message" has default text, but an "intro" streamfield simply starts out empty and the user has to add a block from the types. 
Would be nice to a) have a default block and b) have multiple blocks with content.)

# Container Block
5) Look at a Container block that let's people put content inside some other container. So from CoreBlocks pick a Container, then select a type/theme. 
Or perhaps it needs a couple of blocks to support. Not sure how to handle number of columns, as if num_cols is a drop down of 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
it then requires 1-4 content streamfields. Define and show them all, or hack the modeladmin React.js to hide things!? If we have 1-col, 2-col,... 
block types defined it's very difficult to add/del a column. Just feels like the wagtail admin could be a lot friendlier and dynamic some times.
